README - SANDY-IV - Jacob Rowell
This project is the 2019-2020 VRC robot program for team 1233F, underdogs. Imported from github account I used in highschool.
It is split into source and header files for each subsystem, each of which has a series of fucntions that can be used to control said subsystem during driver control
and autonomous. Other source files are used to set up sensors, and compartamentalize autonomous and other scripts.
